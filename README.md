# Project Description
PhishShield is a lightweight web application that detects scam and phishing messages using keyword analysis, link risk detection, and an explainable risk scoring system.  
It helps non-technical users understand *why* a message is dangerous instead of just blocking it.

---

# The Problem Statement
Digital fraud cases like phishing, OTP scams, UPI fraud, and fake job offers are rapidly increasing.  
Most existing tools are built for technical users and provide unclear warnings that common people ignore or misunderstand.

---

# The Solution
PhishShield allows users to paste suspicious messages and instantly:

- Calculate scam probability score
- Detect malicious or shortened links
- Highlight risky language
- Provide clear explanations
- Give voice alerts for accessibility

This makes scam detection simple, explainable, and user-friendly.
